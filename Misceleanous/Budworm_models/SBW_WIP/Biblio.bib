  abstract = {Maintaining an adaptive seasonality, with life cycle events occurring at appropriate times of year and in synchrony with cohorts and ephemeral resources, is a basic ecological requisite for many cold-blooded organisms. There are many mechanisms for synchronizing developmental milestones, such as egg laying (oviposition), egg hatching, cocoon opening, and the emergence of adults. These are often irreversible, specific to particular life stages, and include diapause, an altered physiological state which can be reversed by some synchronizing environmental cue (e.g. photoperiod). However, many successful organisms display none of these mechanisms for maintaining adaptive seasonality. In this paper, we briefly review the mathematical relationship between environmental temperatures and developmental timing and discuss the consequences of viewing these models as circle maps from the cycle of yearly oviposition dates and temperatures to oviposition dates for subsequent generations. Of particular interest biologically are life cycles which are timed to complete in exactly 1 year, or univoltine cycles. Univoltinism, associated with reproductive success for many temperate species, is related to stable fixed points of the developmental circle map. Univoltine fixed points are stable and robust in broad temperature bands, but lose stability suddenly to maladaptive cycles at the edges of these bands. Adaptive seasonality may therefore break down with little warning with constantly increasing or decreasing temperature change, as in scenarios for global warming. These ideas are illustrated and explored in the context of Mountain Pine Beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) occurring in the marginal thermal habitat of central Idaho's Rocky Mountains. Applications of these techniques have not been widely explored by the applied math community, but are likely to provide great insight into the response of biological systems to climate change.},

  abstract      = {Much evidence is accumulating that insect distributions are changing. The changing earth's climate is providing mobile species with an evolving ``hospitability'' template, and increasing global commerce expands opportunities for mobile species to colonize new habitats. Predicting the distribution of insects in the face of accelerating global commerce and climate change is quite a challenge. Many fruitful approaches are available and are being improved. Some are correlative; some are based on process-level knowledge. We have focused on an eco-physiological approach based on the known responses of species to specific weather factors at the physiological level. Of particular importance are developmental responses, of course, as they determine climates under which an insect can achieve a stable, adaptive seasonality. With this underlying minimal requirement, models can also take into account other weather influences such as cold tolerance and the deleterious effects of too much heat. In this paper, we illustrated the use of this approach to predict the change of distribution and potential impacts of the spruce budworm Choristoneura fumiferana (Clem.), a major native insect pest of conifer forests in North America. Like previous work on the invasive gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar L.) and the native mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins), the present work points to the following conclusions concerning the effects of global warming on species distributions: (1) they will shift towards the poles (and to higher elevations); (2) temperate regions will bear the brunt of these shifts; and (3) distribution shifts may be good or bad, depending on the species and the regions concerned.},
